    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This layered candy cane dessert is the perfect no-bake treat to serve at a potluck, holiday party, or any winter
        event. This dessert is layered with an Oreo cookie crust, a creamy candy cane layer, cheesecake pudding,
        homemade whipped topping, and a sprinkle of crushed candy canes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (13.29 ounce) package Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookies</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup marshmallow fluff</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>8 full-size candy canes (about 4 ounces), crushed, divided</li>
        <li>2 (3.4 ounce) boxes cheesecake flavored instant pudding mix</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups cold whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add Oreos to the bowl of a food processor, and pulse until finely crushed. Stir crushed Oreos and melted
            butter together in a bowl until fully incorporated. Firmly press Oreo mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch
            pan and place in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Add heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar to a large bowl. Whip on high speed until soft
            peaks form. Place marshmallow fluff in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave until just melted, about 10
            seconds. Beat marshmallow fluff into whipped cream until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add cream cheese and remaining 1 cup powdered sugar to another large bowl; beat until fluffy. Fold in half
            of whipped topping and half of crushed candy canes until incorporated. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add cheesecake flavored instant pudding and cold milk to a large bowl and beat until set, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove Oreo crust from the refrigerator. Layer on cream cheese-candy cane mixture, then cheesecake pudding,
            and finally top with remaining whipped topping. Cover and refrigerate for at least 5 hours. Immediately
            before serving, sprinkle on remaining half of crushed candy canes (if done ahead, candy canes will bleed
            color and melt into the topping).</li>
    </ol>
